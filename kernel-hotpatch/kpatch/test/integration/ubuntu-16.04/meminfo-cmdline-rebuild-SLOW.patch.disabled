Disabled:
kpatch-build currently fails with "invalid ancestor" error. This happens
with at least drivers/gpu/drm/i2c/adv7511.o and drivers/hwmon/htu21.o
files. The problem is their .ko counterparts are never built for some
reason, This looks like a kernel bug since in both cases there are files
with same name but in different paths that have .ko module built.
