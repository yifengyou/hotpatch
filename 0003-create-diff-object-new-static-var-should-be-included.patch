Subject: [PATCH 03/21] create-diff-object: new static var should be included

Before this patch, only global variables(no referenced) will be
included by kpatch-build. But some macros put some static varibles
in the object file, and no function references it, so they won't
be included by kpatch-build. Because they are changed, the kpatch
will report an error.
This patch includes all new static variables, and this method won't
cause a problem even the new static variables are in unbundled section.
